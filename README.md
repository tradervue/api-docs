Tradervue API
=============

The Tradervue API is a REST-style API for [Tradervue](http://www.tradervue.com)
that uses JSON for serialization, and HTTP Basic authentication over
SSL.

Refer to the [change log](CHANGELOG.md) for the history of API changes.

Making a request
----------------

All URLs start with `https://app.tradervue.com/api/v1`, and are accessible via SSL only.

Authentication
--------------

You use HTTP Basic authentication to authenticate with the Tradervue API.

Identify your app
-----------------

You must include a `User-Agent` header that identifies your application, including either a link
to your application or your email address, with each request. This allows us to get in touch with
you in case there is a problem (so we can warn you before you're blacklisted), or if we want to
talk to you about your app!  Something like:

```
User-Agent: TradeImporter (http://my-tradeimporter.com)
```

or

```
User-Agent: MyApp (yourname@example.com)
```

If you don't supply this header, you will get a HTTP 400 Bad Request response.

Multiple Users
--------------

If you are the administrator of an organization in Tradervue, and this feature has been enabled
for your organization, you can issue API calls on behalf of users in your organization. You could
use this to auto-import trades for your users, for example.

To issue an API call on behalf of another user, you should authenticate as the organization
administrator, and include a Tradervue-UserId HTTP header that identifies the target user. Something
like:

```
Tradervue-UserId: 78914
```

If you do not have permission to issue API calls for the specified user, you will get a HTTP 403
Not Authorized response.

*Note: the "X-" prefix for non-standard headers has been deprecated
in [RFC 6648](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6648), which is why it is not used here.*
