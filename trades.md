### Listing trades

To list the trades, you will use

`GET /api/v1/trades`

#### Request

There are no required parameters in the request. From the command line, you can use the following curl command:

```
curl -i \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "User-Agent: MyApp (yourname@example.com)" \
  -u example:password \
  "https://app.tradervue.com/api/v1/trades"
```

#### Response

The response will look like:

```json

  ]
}
```

Trade results will be sorted with the newest trade first, by trade open date/time. For trades with no executions,
which have no open time, the creation time of the trade will be used instead.

The exit_price field will be omitted if the trade is open.

While there are no required parameters to retrieve the list of trades, there are several optional parameters you can use:

Parameter | Description |
--------- | ----------- |
count     | Specifies how many trades you want back at a time. Defaults to 25, max is 100. |
page      | Specifies which page of results you want. For example, if you want results 26-50, use count=25&page=2. |
symbol    | Filter results to a specific symbol, e.g. symbol=AAPL |
ortags    | Filter results to trades that contains at least of the specified tags, e.g. ortags=MyTag or ortags=MyTag,TagTwo |
andtags   | Filter results to trades that contains all of the tags specified tags, e.g. andtags=MyTag or andtags=MyTag,TagTwo |
startdate | Filter results to trades opened on or after the start date, formatted as mm/dd/yyyy (URL-encode the slashes in your request) |
enddate   | Filter results to trades opened on or before the enddate date, formatted as mm/dd/yyyy (URL-encode the slashes in your request) |
side      | Filter results to long or short trades only. Use side=L for long, and side=S for short. |
duration  | Filter results by intraday or multiday trades. Use duration=I for intraday, and duration=M for multi-day trades. |

There are a number of other filter options that can be used; if you build a filter on the Tradervue web site using the drill-down
interactive reports, and examine the URL immediately after narrowing the filter, you will see some of the available filter parameters.

All parameters should be sent as query strings in the URL, for example: `/api/v1/trades?ortags=MyTag&side=S`

### Displaying a single trade

You can retrieve details about a particular trade by using

`GET /api/v1/trades/{id}`

#### Request

The trade's ID is part of the request URL. From the command line, you can use the following curl command:

```
curl -i \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "User-Agent: MyApp (yourname@example.com)" \
  -u example:password \
  "https://app.tradervue.com/api/v1/trades/643888"
```

#### Response

The response will look like:

```json
{
  "id": 643888,
  "symbol": "BBY",
  "volume": 160,
  "open": false,
  "gross_pl": -5.592,

  "tags": [
    "pb15",
    "pullback",

  ],
  "initial_risk": 20.0,

}
```

Note that the exit_price field will be omitted if the trade is open.

### Updating a trade

To update a trade, you will use

`PUT /api/v1/trades/{id}`

You can update the following fields for a trade:

- notes
- shared
- initial risk
- tags

#### Request

The trade's ID is part of the request URL. From the command line, you can use the following curl command:

```
curl -i \
  -X PUT \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "User-Agent: MyApp (yourname@example.com)" \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -u example:password \
  -d '{"notes":"here are my notes"}' \
  "https://app.tradervue.com/api/v1/trades/659080"
```

A sample JSON request looks like this:

```json
{
  "notes": "here are my notes",
  "shared": true,
  "initial_risk": 15.00,
  "tags": [
    "one",
    "two",
    "three"
  ]
}
```

Only the fields you wish to update need to be included; all other fields will be left unmodified.

#### Response

If successful, you will get a HTTP 200 response and an empty body.

If the trade wasn't found, you will get a HTTP 404.

If the update failed, you will get a HTTP 400 with a JSON response like

```json
{
  "error": "error details here, here, here"
}
```

### Creating a trade

To create a new trade, you will use

`POST /api/v1/trades`

This will create a new trade with no executions, similar to what happens when you click "New Trade" on the Tradervue
site and fill in the form there.

#### Request

From the command line, you can use the following curl command:

```
curl -i \
  -X POST \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "User-Agent: MyApp (yourname@example.com)" \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -u example:password \
  -d '{"symbol":"AAAA","notes":"foo","initial_risk":25.0,"shared":false,"tags":["tag1","tag2"]}' \
  "https://app.tradervue.com/api/v1/trades"
```

A sample JSON request looks like this:

```json
{
  "symbol": "AAAA",
  "notes": "foo",
  "initial_risk": 25.0,
  "shared": false,
  "tags": [
    "tag1",
    "tag2"
  ]
}
```

The symbol field is required; all other fields are optional.

If the notes field is specified (even if an empty string), the notes in the new trade will be set to that.
If the notes field is omitted, the notes will be set from the user's default trade notes template.

#### Response

If successful, you will get a HTTP 201 response with a Location header containing the new trade's URL:

```
Location: https://app.tradervue.com/api/v1/trades/12345
```

The JSON response will include the new trade's ID:

```json
{
  "id":12345
}
```

If the trade could not be created, you will get a HTTP 400 with a JSON response like

```json
{
  "error": "error details here, here, here"
}
```

### Deleting a trade

To delete a trade, you will use

`DELETE /api/v1/trades/{id}`

This will delete the trade, including any executions that make up the trade, and any comments on the trade.

#### Request

From the command line, you can use the following curl command:

```
curl -i \
  -X DELETE \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "User-Agent: MyApp (yourname@example.com)" \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -u example:password \
  "https://app.tradervue.com/api/v1/trades/46525"
```
